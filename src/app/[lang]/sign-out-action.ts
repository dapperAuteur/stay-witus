/**
 * GLOBAL SIGN-OUT on the WitUS-branded platform host, purely local everywhere else.
 *
 * BAM's decision (2026-08-30): signing out of one WitUS app signs you out of all of
 * them. Ending only the local session leaves the IdP session alive, which — now that
 * the sign-in page offers "Continue as ..." — means signing out and coming back
 * offers to sign you straight back in, and reads as a broken logout.
 *
 * ON A HOTEL TENANT DOMAIN THIS STAYS ENTIRELY LOCAL. witusEcosystemEnabled is the
 * SAME gate that hides the sign-in button (src/lib/witus-sso.ts), resolved on the
 * server from the request Host, never from anything the form posted. A hotel's guest
 * must not be redirected to accounts.witus.online on their way out any more than on
 * their way in: one request reveals the ecosystem exists and tells it someone visited
 * that hotel. `lang` is the only client-supplied value here and it decides nothing
 * beyond which local page the local path returns to.
