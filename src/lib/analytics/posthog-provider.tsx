/**
 * Initialises PostHog once, in the browser, and only when a key is configured. This is
 * this repo's copy of the ecosystem-standard provider (reference:
 * gemini/witus/lib/analytics/posthog-provider.tsx, contract in plans/26 there). The
 * init options are byte-identical to the standard on purpose — see below.
 *
 * Keyless is a first-class state, not a failure: local dev, previews, and any deploy
 * before the env vars are set all render normally with capture switched off. Every
 * helper in ./capture no-ops when this never ran.
 *
 * Privacy posture — decided ecosystem-wide 2026-07-28 (witus plans/26), set here rather
 * than in the PostHog dashboard so it is reviewable in the diff and cannot be changed by
 * someone clicking a toggle. Do not tune these locally; they are what the ecosystem
 * conformance checker asserts, and a change here is an ecosystem decision:
 *
 * - `autocapture: false` — autocapture records every click and keystroke, which in a
 *   lodging product means the booking form: guest name, email, phone, and the
 *   mobile-money number typed into a Ghana payment flow. People typed those to complete
 *   a reservation, not to be measured by a third party. It is also the main driver of
 *   event volume against the shared project's quota. A named list is sent instead
 *   (see ./events).
 * - `disable_session_recording: true` — same objection, much larger. A replay of the
 *   booking or payment step would record exactly the guest data this app refuses to send
 *   off-site anywhere else (src/lib/sentry-scrub.ts). Input masking is mitigation, not
 *   exemption.
 * - `persistence: "memory"` — no cookie, no localStorage. Analytics identity lives for
 *   one page session and is then gone, which is why this ships WITHOUT a consent banner
 *   on hotel tenant domains — where a banner would also be a white-label problem, since
 *   it is the platform, not the hotel, asking. The cost is real and worth stating: every
 *   hard navigation looks like a new visitor, so unique-visitor counts inflate and
 *   returning-visitor is always zero. Treat unique counts as sessions. Ratios between
 *   events — what share of /book views reach /book/done — survive this distortion, and
 *   those are the questions worth asking here.
 * - `capture_pageview: false` — Next's client router does not do full page loads, so
 *   PostHog's automatic pageview would fire once and then under-report every subsequent
 *   route. Route views are explicit in the taxonomy instead.
 *
 * `api_host` points at our own `/ingest` path, which next.config.ts rewrites to
 * PostHog. Ad blockers match on the vendor hostname, so proxying through our origin is
 * what stops a large share of events — including our own test visits — from being
 * dropped before they are ever sent. `ui_host` still has to name the real dashboard so
 * "view in PostHog" links resolve.

  //
  // safePathname() is this repo's ONE departure from the standard provider, and it is
