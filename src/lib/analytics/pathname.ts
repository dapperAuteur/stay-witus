/**
 * Make a pathname safe to send to a third-party analytics vendor.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The ecosystem standard captures `route_viewed` with the raw
 * `usePathname()` value. In most apps that is harmless. In this one it is not: staff
 * invites and partner self-edit links are BEARER CREDENTIALS carried in the path
 * (`/en/invite/<token>`, `/en/partner/<token>`, both
 * `randomBytes(24).toString("base64url")`). Sending that pathname verbatim would hand a
 * live, unexpired credential to PostHog — a copy of the exact secret the recipient's
 * email was supposed to be the only carrier of.
 *
 * src/lib/sentry-scrub.ts already refuses to let those URLs reach the error sink for
 * the same reason. This is the analytics half of that rule; it is a separate, smaller
 * copy on purpose, because sentry-scrub is server-side and pulling it into the browser
 * bundle to reuse one regex would be the worse trade. If the token FORMAT ever changes,
 * change it in both places.
 *
 * The route SHAPE survives — `/en/invite/<token>` is still attributable to the invite
 * flow — which is the half worth keeping. Only credential-shaped segments are
 * collapsed; opaque record ids (a support ticket, a room slug) are left alone, because
 * they are not secrets and the room slug in particular is a signal worth having.

 * Positional, so it holds whatever the token looks like — this is the guarantee, and

 * turns out not to carry a secret costs one collapsed analytics value; omitting one
 * that does costs a leaked credential.

 * case in practice (a 32-char base64url string with no uppercase is a ~1-in-10-million
 * event); an authored slug is lowercase kebab-case. So: long AND (has uppercase OR has
