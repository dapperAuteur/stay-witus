// Ecosystem SSO, the two halves that need pure logic: the silent
// "Continue as <name>" check on the sign-in page, and the RP-initiated global
// sign-out. See src/lib/witus-sso.ts for the GATE that decides whether either
// one runs at all — this file only implements what happens once it says yes.
//
// WHY THIS FILE IS PURE. It has no "server-only", no next/headers, no window
// access at module scope, and no import from @/lib/env. That is deliberate
// three ways: the sign-in button is a client component and cannot import a
// module that touches next/headers; the tests import these functions directly
// (no test in this repo uses vi.mock, and a leak-prevention path is the last
// place to start); and keeping the IdP URL derivation next to the parsing keeps
// both testable against the same discovery URL.
//
// WHAT THE PROBE BUYS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. runSilentSsoProbe sends the IdP's
// cookie as a THIRD-PARTY cookie, so it answers on Chrome/Edge and returns
// nothing under Safari ITP or Firefox Total Cookie Protection. That is the
// design, not a bug: a probe that answers nothing renders nothing, and the
// visitor keeps the exact sign-in page they already had.
//
// THE NAME THIS RETURNS IS DISPLAY COPY, NEVER A CREDENTIAL. It arrives from a
// cross-origin response, so it is client-supplied by definition. It must never
// gate access, populate a session, or be sent anywhere. Clicking the button runs
// the real OIDC code flow (signInWithWitus, which re-checks the host gate),
// which is the only thing that establishes identity here.
