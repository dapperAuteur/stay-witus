/**
 * The submit button of the "Sign in with WitUS" form, plus the silent
 * "Continue as <name>" check layered on top of it.
 *
 * PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT, NOT A REPLACEMENT. The parent is still the plain
 * `<form action={signInWithWitus}>` server-action form it was before, and this is
 * still a `type="submit"` button inside it — so the ecosystem flow keeps working
 * with client JS off, which is the property the whole sign-in page is built around.
 * All this component adds is a better label and the loop-guard marker.
 *
 * THE GATE IS THE WHOLE POINT. `enabled` is resolved on the SERVER from the request
 * host (showWitusSignIn, src/lib/witus-sso.ts) and is never derived here or supplied
 * by the client. A hotel tenant's guest must never so much as touch
 * accounts.witus.online: that single request would both reveal the ecosystem exists
 * and tell it someone visited that hotel. The sign-in page already renders this
 * component only behind the gate and only passes `silentCheckUrl` there; `enabled`
 * repeats it as a hard precondition so a future caller who forgets the wrapper gets
 * an inert button rather than a leak.
 *
 * WHAT THE VISITOR SEES. The form is already on screen; nothing here delays it. The
 * button reads "Sign in with WitUS" from first paint. If the probe finds a WitUS
 * session it becomes "Continue as <name>". If the probe fails, times out, or the
 * browser blocks third-party cookies, nothing changes and nothing is said — a failed
 * silent check is invisible.
